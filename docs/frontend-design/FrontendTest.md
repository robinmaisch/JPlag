# Frontend Test

To check the output of your frontend against the input, the `TokenPrinter` can be helpful. The `TokenPrinter` prints the input line by line, and the tokens of each line below it.

```java
10 public class Example {
   |CLASS               |CLASS{
    
11      private int number;
        |FIELD 
        
12      public int getNumber() {
        |METHOD                |METHOD{
            
13          return number;
            |RETURN
       
14      }
        |}METHOD
   
15 }
   |}CLASS
```
To test a frontend, set up a JUnit test class where the `TokenPrinter` prints the output of the `parse` method of the frontend. Read through the output and check whether the `TokenList` satisfies the given requirements.

### Test files

The frontend should be tested with 'authentic' sample code as well as a 'complete' test file that covers all syntactic elements that the frontend should take into account. If you are using an ANTLR parser, such a complete test file may be included in the parser test files in the ANTLRv4 Grammar Repository. 

### Sanity check suggestions

- The TokenList represents the input code correctly.
  - In particular, the nesting tokens are correctly nested and balanced.

- The TokenList represents the input code with an acceptable coverageâ€”how that can be measured and what coverage is acceptable depends on the language. One approach would be line coverage, e.g. 90 percent of code lines should contain a token.

- There are no `TokenConstants` that can never be produced by the frontend for any input.
  - Put another way, the complete test code produces a TokenList that contains every type of token.
